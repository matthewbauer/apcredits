    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students must consult with their Program Advisor to review Advanced Placement examinations and the transferability of AP credits. Transfer credits do not impact a student's GPA. Peirce College will use the American Council on Education's (ACE) recommended credit-granting score to determine eligibility for awarding credits for AP Exams. Official documentation of the exam(s) and score(s) must be provided to obtain credit.</i>
