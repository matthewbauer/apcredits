    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>In order to receive credit for an Advanced Placement course, student must earn at least a 3 on the exam. In some instances a 4 will be required to have the course waived. In these cases, students may receive credit for an elective course rather than the specific AP course. Students should have official AP score report forwarded to the Office of Admissions.</i>
