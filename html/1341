    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students entering Jackson State University for the first time are allowed credit on the Advanced Placement Examination administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Grades are recorded on the student's transcript for courses in which advanced placement credit is earned. These courses do not affect grade point averages. Acceptance of advanced placement credits to a specific degree will be determined by the major department chair and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. The student must submit an official copy of the AP Exam from the College Entrance Examination Board.</i>
