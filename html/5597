    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>The college will accept AP scores of 3, 4, and 5 as follows: 1. Scores may be accepted in fulfillment of specific courses, as part of a distribution/area/general requirement, or as free electives in a degree program. 2. The recommended number of semester hours will be awarded per accepted score if the student uses it as a free elective; if the student uses it in lieu of a specific course, he/she will be awarded no more than the hours of the Roanoke course. In no instance may credit hours for one examination be divided between a specific course and elective hours. 3. A grade of P (pass) will be assigned; the hours will not count in the student's GPA. 4. The work may not duplicate previous college work.</i>
