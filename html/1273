    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students who complete AP Exams should request that results be sent to Ivy Tech State College at the specific region they plan to attend. Credit will be granted only if the AP Exams are applicable to the program concerned and if the student enrolls in the Ivy Tech program within one year. A minimum score of 3 is required. Fees for AP are paid while the student is in high school. Students should contact their high school counselor for information about AP tests.</i>
