    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Brewton-Parker College accepts credits from all non-traditional sources recognized by the American Council on Education [ACE], including AP credits, and follows ACE recommendations in assigning credit hours. Non-traditional credit will not be assigned a grade equivalent and thus will not factor into the GPA. A maximum of 30 semester hours of credit toward graduation may be earned on the basis of ACE recommended credit.</i>
