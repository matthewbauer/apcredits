    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Advanced placement courses and examinations completed at a high school will be evaluated upon receipt of an official transcript from the College Board program. Scores of three, four, and five will be awarded credit at Minnesota West. Credit may be given for a specific college course if a test covers substantially similar material. If the test material does not match an existing course, students may be given elective credits.</i>
