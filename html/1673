    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>To receive Rend Lake College Credit, students must earn a score of 3, 4, or 5, and must request the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to send an official copy of the examination results to Rend Lake College. The examination results must be received prior to the student taking the course for which credit is sought. Credit will be placed on the student's transcript after the student successfully completes 12 credit hours of study at Rend Lake College. AP credit is not used in computing a student's grade point average. Students may only receive credit for one Rend Lake College course per subject area via AP credit. For specific information, students should contact the Vice President of Instruction.</i>
