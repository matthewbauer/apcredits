    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>High school seniors and traditional transfer students who have taken Advanced Placement examinations administered by the College Board, and who receive a score of 3, 4, or 5, will be awarded credit in accordance with College policy, with the exception of English in which only a score of 4 or 5 is acceptable as elective credit. The student must have the official score sheet sent to college. Eligibility will be determined and credit awarded to the student upon enrollment in the college. Such credit will not exceed a maximum of 30 credits and will not count toward the 30-credit residency requirement. Waiver of requirements in any given subject area will be at the discretion of the divisional faculty.</i>
