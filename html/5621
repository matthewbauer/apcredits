    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Southeastern University awards college credit to students who participated in the Advanced Placement program in high school. Most courses with a score of 3, 4 or 5 earn three college credits. No grade or quality points are assigned for award credit. Applicants must submit original AP scores to the Office of the Registrar for evaluation.</i>
