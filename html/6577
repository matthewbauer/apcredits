    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>AP credits may be used to satisfy degree requirements, but do not apply to the credit hour residency requirement set by the College. Students who submit a score of 4 or 5 on an AP exam to the Office of Enrollment Management and Registrar's Office are given credit in the appropriate course(s). The scores may be used for placement into higher level courses and to satisfy departmental major and minor requirements, as allowed by the individual divisions.</i>
