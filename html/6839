    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>This program enables high school students to take comprehensive examinations for credit at the college level. Inquiries concerning this program should be directed to the high school counselor and arrangements for taking the examination and scoring will be coordinated at the high school in which the student is enrolled. TCC does not administer the AP exam. TCC will award college credit with qualifying scores in specified subject areas that are determined by the academic division that administers the discipline of that course. Submit score sheets to the Enrollment Services Office.</i>
