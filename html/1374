    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Offical transcripts will be evaluated for credits taken at other nationally accredited colleges and universities.  Credit hours are transferred, not grades, and they are not calculated in cumulative gpa.  Classes with A, B and C grades are accepted; classes with D grades are accepted if the student transfers with a 2.0 gpa or above except for ENG 101 and 102, where nothing lower than a C is accepted.  For credits from non-accredited institutions, proficiency exams will be required.  Complete policy information is available on the website and in the college catalog.</i>
