    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>NGTC credit may also be awarded based on the nationally normed exams CLEP (College Level Examination Program) and AP (Advanced Placement) for successful completion of appropriate subject area exams. The student must arrange to have official transcripts provided to the NGTC Admissions Office. Credit is awarded only in areas offered within the current curriculum of NGTC. An equivalent grade of &quot;C&quot; will be required in order for credit to be awarded. Credit granted by exemption will be counted to satisfy requirements for graduation but will not be used to determine academic standing or to calculate grade point average (GPA).</i>
