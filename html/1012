    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>All advanced placement courses are accepted at Alverno. To meet criteria, the student must have earned a grade of B or better. It is not always necessary to take the corresponding AP exam: The need to take the exam is predicated on where the student wants to apply the course in her degree program.</i>
