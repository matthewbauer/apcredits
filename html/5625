    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Credit or course waivers may be granted for satisfactory attainment on Advanced Placement Exams. Credit will be given only in those areas in which comparable courses are offered at the university and will be determined by evaluation procedures set forth by the academic divisions. No grades will be assigned to the courses, nor will they be figured into a student's grade point average. Official results must be sent to the registrar for analysis before credit is granted.</i>
