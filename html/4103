    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students who receive AP scores of three (3), four (4) or five (5) in the approved subject areas will be granted Advanced Placement credit at Pierce College. AP scores of four (4) or five (5) will be treated as course work receiving an &quot;A&quot; (4.0) grade and scores of three (3) will be treated as work receiving a &quot;B&quot; (3.0) grade. AP grades will be counted in the student's final degree evaluation. There is no charge for Advanced Placement credit granted by Pierce College. However, prior to requesting an evaluation of Advanced Placement credits, a student must successfully complete 15 credits of college-level (courses numbered 100 or higher) work at Pierce College with a 2.0 or higher grade point average.</i>
