    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>The nature and scope of material examined must be comparable to courses offered at Burlington College. BC generally follows the American Council on Education's (ACE) recommendations for determining minimum examination scores and the number of credits to be accepted. However, we reserve the right to set a higher standard for some examinations in order to establish equivalency to BC courses. Credit for examination can not be evaluated from a college or high school transcripts; an official score report issued directly from the examination program/organization or an official ACE Credit Recommendations transcript is required. In general, credits by examination are comparable to freshman/sophomore level credits numbered 100-299 at BC.</i>
