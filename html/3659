    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Undergraduate students may receive up to 4 credits in addition to transfer credits towards the Bachelor's degree through the AP Program, provided they do not take courses covering the same material.  NEC accepts AP scores of 3 or better in general studies and appropriate electives, but requires scores of 4 or better on the English Literature/Composition or the English Language/Composition exam to exempt students from the first-year writing requirement.</i>
