    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Secondary school students who receive scores of 4 or 5 on an Advanced Placement Exam may be granted Advanced Placement and college credit in appropriate subjects toward the degree and the major/minor. A grade of P is assigned for these credits. When Advanced Placement credit is awarded for work that is the equivalent of specific Sacred Heart University courses (e.g., Biology 111, English 101), students may not take those courses for credit.</i>
