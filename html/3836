    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>If you participated in AP programs during your secondary school career and took the applicable examinations, you may be eligible for credit for equivalent courses at The Art Institute of Washington. Students must earn a score of 3 or higher on an AP Exam. Copies of AP score reports must be submitted to the Admissions Office as part of the application process. Advanced placement credit will be recorded on the student's transcript as P credit. While the credit will count toward the required number of hours in a student's degree program, no grades will be assigned. This credit will not be computed in the student's GPA or CGPA and will not count as credit attempted.</i>
