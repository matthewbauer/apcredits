    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students who have taken Advanced Placement courses during high school (at designated high schools throughout the United States) may receive college credit for the courses listed in the catalog if they have AP scores of 3 or higher (on a scale of 1-5).  In order to receive credit for AP or CLEP exams, students must request that their exam grades be sent to the Registrar. There is a $50 per credit hour fee from Lincoln Christian to have the AP or CLEP course listed in substitution for a comparable Lincoln Christian course.</i>
