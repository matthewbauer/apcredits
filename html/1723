    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Credits awarded for AP may be applied to degree programs. Acceptable test scores are based on recommendations from the American Council on Education. The AP credits are not used in computing the student's GPA. AP credit will not be awarded if the student has taken or takes the same course at SEBC or transfers the course to SEBC from another college.</i>
