    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students who receive a score of 3, 4, or 5 on an Advanced Placement exam may receive college credit. The credit will be transferred in as part of the student's general education requirements, at the discretion of the Registrar.  A maximum of 30 units can be awarded for advanced credit (AP, IB).  If a student takes a college course for which test credit has already been received, the student forfeits the AP/IB credit.  Students who wish to receive credit for their Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate exams will need to submit their official test scores to the Registrar's Office. A maximum of 16 units can be awarded for CLEP.</i>
