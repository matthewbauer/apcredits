    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>A student who submits the official test transcript verifying earned scores of 3, 4, or 5 may be awarded college credit for an equivalent course listed in the general catalog. This policy includes the opportunity for a high school graduate to enter with sophomore standing if sufficient credit has been earned in the AP program. Credit permitted will only be allowed for the corresponding course or sequence of courses at the college, but no grade will be assigned to the approved credit nor will the hours meet residency requirements.</i>
