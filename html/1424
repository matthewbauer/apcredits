    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Lake Land College grants credit for courses taken by high school students who participate in the Advanced Placement Program. Credit is based on course examinations administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Depending on the examination taken, a student must score 3, 4 or 5 in order to receive credit. Credit will not be used to calculate grade point averages. A maximum of fifteen (15) hours of Advanced Placement credit can be used toward graduation requirements. All scores will be individually evaluated to determine specific course credit and the amount of credit to be awarded.</i>
