    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>To get credit by Advanced Placement (AP) tests of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB),
you must request that an official copy of your scores be sent to the GTCC Admissions Office. For AP tests not already evaluated by faculty, the Registrar will review the scores and recommend courses for credit on an Advanced Standing Certificate, which is sent to the appropriate department chair. The
department chair must approve and return the form to Enrollment Services. Only scores of three or higher will be approved for credit. Advanced Placement tests in some areas may not be accepted if they do not apply to your program of study.</i>
