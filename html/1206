    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Credit may be granted in appropriate areas for the Advanced Placement Exams if a score of three or better is earned. All credit by examination is shown on the record as &quot;Proficiency&quot; with the grade given as &quot;P&quot; (Pass). The number of hours of credit is shown but not counted in calculating the student's grade point average. Any student wishing to arrange for consideration of credit by examination must do so before beginning work at Eureka.</i>
