<p>
    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students who have taken part in the Advanced Placement
Program of the College Board may receive course
credit for each examination in which an acceptable grade
is earned. If a student earns a grade of 3, 4, or 5 he or
she may be granted credit in the subject areas. Advanced
Placement scores below 3 are not acceptable for course
credit. These credits are counted as hours earned and
may be applicable toward a degree. These credits do not
affect the studentÂ’s semester grade point average. Students
who have participated in this program and who
plan to register at Dillard University should have their
Advanced Placement Examination records sent to the
Office of Enrollment Management prior to enrollment.</i>
