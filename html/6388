    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>The Advanced Placement program is administered by the College Entrance Examination Board through which high school students complete designated college level courses in high schools and earn college credit by demonstrating a specified level of performance on AP exams. Students must have their official AP score report sent directly from the College Entrance Examination Board to Century's Records Office. An AP exam score of 3 or higher on a 5 point scale will be considered for transfer. A complete list of AP exams and how they transfer to Century is available through u.select.</i>
