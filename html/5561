    <i>PVCC accepts the philosophy that its placement function includes aiding students who wish to move toward their goals in as efficient a rate as possible. The Advanced Placement Program is designed to indicate that a secondary school student has mastered the material in a course sufficiently equivalent to a beginning college course.</i>
