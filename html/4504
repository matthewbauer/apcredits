    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Although we do not accept AP Studio Art credit, we acknowledge the effort and rigor these courses can offer a young artist. PNCA grants credit for specific requirements based on Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations of the College Board. Scores must be submitted to PNCA by the testing service. Credit is available in Art History, English Literature, Sciences, Calculus and Social Science.</i>
