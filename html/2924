    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Cadets may be excused from (validate) certain core courses if they have sufficient knowledge of a subject to meet appropriate department's standards. Credit earned in other colleges, Advanced Placement Examination scores, and tests administered at the Military Academy considered in validation decisions. Advanced Placement Examination scores may be used in mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, social sciences, and foreign languages. Validation of core courses allows cadet to substitute additional elective in place of core course.</i>
