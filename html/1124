    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>CIM/CWRU grants degree credit and placement in advanced courses based on the results of the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations and CIM-administered admission examinations. The appropriate departments make credit and placement determinations. A College Board Advanced Placement score of 4 or higher may receive favorable consideration. Students enrolled in high schools that do not offer Advanced Placement courses, but who wish to take the examinations, should contact their high school counselors for registration information. It is the applicant's responsibility to have Advanced Placement scores sent to the CIM Admission Office. Such credit must be declared and awarded during the first year of study.</i>
