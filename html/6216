    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>Students who score four or five on Advanced Placement tests may be awarded college credit through Fontbonne, subject to the approval of the appropriate department. Each department will decide the amount of credit and the specific course for which credit will be given.

A student who scores one, two, or three on Advanced Placement tests will not receive advanced placement or earn college credit. Official test scores must be received directly from the testing agency.</i>
