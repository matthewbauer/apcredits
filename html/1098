    <strong>From the college:</strong>
    <i>College credit will be considered for AP courses taken while in high school when the student presents an official score to the Admissions Office for review. The AP course in question must correspond with a course offered by the College. The final decision on whether an AP course is accepted, and the number of semester hours that will be granted, will be made by the Registrar in consultation with the appropriate departmental chair and the VPAA of the College. AP credit, like CLEP credit, is recorded without a letter grade, and has no effect upon the overall GPA.</i>
